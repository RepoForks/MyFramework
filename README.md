### 1. MVVM architecture ###
  - in this struct i have divided the whole project into four part 

    1.ACTIVITY

    2.FRAGMENT

    3.VIEWMODEL

    4.NAVIGATOR.

  - all of you know about the activity, fragment and viewmodel but I have totally change this things like below.

  - ACTIVITY will divid in two ways MvvmActivity<BindObject, ViewModelObject> AND NavigatingMvvmActivity<NavigatorObject, BindObject, ViewModelObject>.

  - FRAGMENT will divid in two ways MvvmFragment<BindObject, ViewModelObject> AND NavigatingMvvmFramgment<NavigatorObject, BindObject, ViewModelObject>.

  - DIALOGFRAGMENT will divid in two ways NavigatingMvvmDialogFragment<BindObject, ViewModelObject> AND NavigatingMvvmDialogFragment<NavigatorObject, BindObject, ViewModelObject>.

  - also it will handle the ACTIVITY AND FRAGMNET event for binding the other component for example you have display progressdialog and press back then dialog will automatically cancel at that time when you use activity or fragment dialog.

### 2. Dialog ###
  - i have create two type of dialog 1.Prompt and 2.Alert dialog.

  - Prompt dialog use for message display purpose with type(INFO, HELP, ERROR/WRONG, SUCCESS, WARNING).

  - Alert dialog use for message or customise.

  - in this feature you can directly set custom font with using set application level default, set layout based on attribute, set particular class based and style based.

### 5. Permission ###
